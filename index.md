I am a first year Ph.D. candidate studying under Dr. Christoffer Heckman in the [ARPG](https://arpg.github.io) lab. My primary interests are in real time robotic perception and control algorithms.

I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2017, and a B.S./M.S. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on controls engineering in 2019. Both majors were earned at the univserity of Colorado - Boulder.

Outside of school I enjoy music, lifting weights, anime, and working on cars.
