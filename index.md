I am a first year Ph.D. candidate studying under Dr. Christoffer Heckman in the [ARPG](https://arpg.github.io) lab. My primary interests is in simultaneous location and mapping in difficult environments. My first publication was [Better Together: Online Probabilistic Clique Change Detection in 3D Landmark-Based Maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00372.pdf) and I am currently working on radar-inertial SLAM in non-ideal environments including dust, fog, and low-light conditions. 

I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics in 2017, and a B.S./M.S. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on controls engineering in 2019. Both majors were earned at the Univserity of Colorado - Boulder.

Outside of school I enjoy music, lifting weights, anime, and working on cars.
